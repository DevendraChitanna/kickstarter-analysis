Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## my analysis of kickstarter campaigns ##

### Overview of Project ###

The purpose of this project was to analyze data on kickstarter to uncover trends. 
 I createed a pivot table to organize the outcome of projects with their respective dates.
 I also created a chart on Outcomes of goals, I used the COUNTIFS function to create this chart.
 I also created a line graph for both my pivot table and my chard to better represent the data. 
 
 #### Analysis and Challenges ####
 
 I created a year collumn and used the YEAR function to retreive the year from the date created conversion 
 collumn. I had trouble when creating my pivot table, because I was not able to get the table to show the dates the same as the example.
 I did not figure how to get it exactly the same but, I kept playing with the variables and the group option to get similar information on the pivot table.
 When creating my chart on outcomes based on goals I had trouble figuring how to correctly use the countifs functions. I was using COUNTIF insted of
 COUNTIFS when creating certin charts. I did research online and I eventully fixed mt issue. 
 
 ##### Results ######
 I found the 2015 had the most seccessful year for projects and that 2014 had the most failures.
